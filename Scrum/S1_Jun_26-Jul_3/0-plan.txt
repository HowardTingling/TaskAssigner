GOAL: Have finalized web design; wireframe; setup.

User Stories:
1. Customer: create an assignment of passenger to drivers to share
	-Create driver(s) with driver capacity so that driver is assigned correct number of passengers
	-Create passenger(s) to be assigned to drivers
2. Customer: Post-assignment, manually reassign passengers and drivers (change mind or enact preferences)
3. Developer: Modular cards that display driver/passenger when created so that it can be used everywhere in other contexts
4. Customer: Easily accessible input system & quick display of results for responsive interactivity (prevent rage)
5. Customer: Printable version for better readability
6. Customer: Sharable so others can see the assignment
7. Customer: Allow for collaborative edit so that assignments can be made based on multiple input preferences
	-Possible solution: require account creation to authenticate specific individuals
8. Developer: Wireframe of website to prevent last minute changes to already implemented design; rollback = wasted labor & time
